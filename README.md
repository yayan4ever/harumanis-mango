# Harumanis Mango
Welcome to the Harumanis Mango repository! This project is dedicated to showcasing the unique characteristics and cultural significance of the Harumanis mango, a prized fruit from Perlis, Malaysia.

About Harumanis Mango
The Harumanis mango, often hailed as the "King of Mangoes," is renowned for its unparalleled sweetness, intense fragrance, and delicate texture. Cultivated primarily in Perlis, Malaysia's smallest state located at the northern tip of the peninsula, this mango variety is celebrated for its distinct creamy and milky taste, accompanied by a strong and unique aroma.

Unlike other mango varieties, Harumanis mangoes have a limited and seasonal harvest, typically available from April to June. This short harvesting period adds to their exclusivity and demand. The mangoes are slightly larger than palm-sized, weighing up to 600 grams each, with an elongated and elliptical shape. Their thick, tough, vibrant green skin protects the soft, orange-colored flesh within. The fruit itself tastes sweet with an ever-so-slightly bitter aftertaste.
